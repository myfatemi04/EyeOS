## What is EyeOS?
EyeOS is a way for people to easily control their computer without the use of their hands. In today's increasingly digital world, it can be extremely disadvantageous to be unable to control a computer. To resolve this issue, we wanted to make something that could help people control their computer simply by looking at where they wanted to click. To set up, simply allow access to the webcam, and calibrate EyeOS by looking at the corners of your screen.
## How does it work?
We are using a computer vision technique called HAAR cascades to quickly find the location of the eyes in real-time.
